coreallocator
=============

This is EA's memory allocation interface package, re-constucted from the partial releases
which EA have made at http://gpl.ea.com.

This repo was put together by Kitsilano Software in the hope that EA will fork it back,
and start maintaining these releases in a form which is actually usable, rather than just
meeting the bare-bones legal and technical requirement to get EAWebKit buildable.
